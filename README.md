# Pandas Portfolio

For this project I used my knowledge of pandas to evaluate the performance of stock portfolios and then create a portfolio of my own. 

I used data metrics such as daily returns, std, annualized std, rolling std (21 day), correlation, variance, covairance, beta, and sharpe ratios to evaluate the performance of each individual portfolio, as well as my own.
